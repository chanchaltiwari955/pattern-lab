It's city living, pure and simple, and it's pretty much all here. The Streeterville neighborhood includes a generous array of high-rise and mid-rise condo and apartments, many of them new construction buildings, as well as the Chicago Tribune Tower, Navy Pier, NBC Tower and a string of hotels.  Streeterville is also home to the Museum of Contemporary Art, the massive sprawling Northwestern University and Northwestern Hospital Campus. For Streeterville apartments, convenience is the name of the game.  It has a relatively small footprint so getting around this neighborhood is easy.  Renters in Streeterville will find shops ranging from the upscale to the ritzy, and the restaurants range from fast food to casual dining to steak houses to haute cuisine near Streeterville apartments. Streeterville also plays host to a 21-screen multiplex, several health clubs and plenty of gourmet grocery options. If you love to walk, Streeterville will suit you well.  Parking is expensive, and walking is the easiest option for getting around.  Since this neighborhood is bounded by the Chicago River and Lake Michigan your backyard is the Chicago Riverwalk, the Lakefront Trail, Navy Pier, Olive Park, Jane Addams Park, Lakeshore Park, and Ohio Street Beach.  If you walk across the Chicago River to the south, you will quickly find yourself at Millennium Park to enjoy the afternoon. In the summer, apartment renters in Streeterville are never more than a short walk to the beach, where you can pick up a trail that extends past the Museum of Science and Industry on the south and extends up through to Evanston on the north.Almost all of the Streeterville luxury apartment buildings and condo buildings with rentals are loaded with amenities.
